                I'm a real tech-nerd so listing everything I'm interested
                and have dabbled in a bit would take way to long,
                but I think these following areas describe what I mostly do when I'm on a <span id="last">computer. </span>

            <p>
                I started out by learning to code, and thats what got me into actually produce stuff on computers rather than to just consume. 
                <br>
                I mostly code in python, or bash, but I've also worked some in Java, Javascript, and C.

            <p>
                Since a few years back I started daily driving Linux as my main OS and I'm incredibly glad that I did.
                Using Linux, and also using a minimal customized installation, has improved my productivity immensly.
                I go into more depth on this on the "Archer" page, which is what I call my custom version of the linux distro "Arch",
                but this system has improved my life in so many ways.

            <h1>Typesetting</h1>
            <p>
                Creating professional and good looking documents is one of my most unusual interests.
                Typesetting utilizing systems like LaTeX, Markdown and Groff/Troff is something I think everyone should start doing.
                These systems make creating documents easier and more scalable, and they look professional.
                I suppose this odd interest is genetic,
                since my grandfather spent his whole life working with typesetting and printing

            <p>To be honest I'm a real amateur when it comes to design,
                but I am passionate about making the websites and applications I develop beutiful.
                Maybe you're not a fan of this website's design,
                but I've spent a very long time designing and styling this website,
                trying to get the perfect balance of minimalism and style, monochrome and color.

            <h1>Hacking</h1>
            <p>
                Hacking is one of those hobbies that I'd like to spend more time to, but it's pretty low on my list of priorities.
                I think hacking is a really fun way to learn about security but since it's in most cases very illegal I don't spend as much time as on it as I'd like to.
